### Howdy ðŸ‘‹
I'm a senior computer engineering student at UQAC and developer at Solutions TLM. So you can either stumble onto gazillion of weird commits or well crafted ones...

I mainly do C++ for academic and Python on the job. Python is where my heart is right now because it's good for fast iterations, it has a lot of insanely good tools and the communities are great. I'm also trained with C, C#, Java and SQL and I dabble with other languages as needed.

I love electronics and hacky projects and I'm also a member of a robotic club.
