My main keyboard is the Ergodox EZ shine and here is the :keyboard: [layout](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/XqXz6/latest/0)

## Things I dislike with the current layout
- Programming layer 6
  - Placement of <{[(: Should be DF=() ER={} CV=[]
  - Where the /\| are: should be T=| G=/ B=\
  - No tild: should be -=~
  - Too much symbols irrelevant to coding: should be on their own layer
